 * OTRadValve ModelledRadValve thermal model tests.

 * Aim is to, for example, model different
 * radiator efficacies, valve behaviours, boiler speeds, radio loss, etc;
 * to ensure that responsiveness, temperature regulation
 * and valve movement/noise/energy are OK.
 *
 * Model for all-in-one and split unit configurations.
 *
 * This can even be extended to DHW tests.
