/*
 * RESERVED CONFIG FOR TRV2
 *
 * Set of ENABLE_XXX flags and V0p2_REV for REV21.
 *
 * This should define (or #undef) ONLY symbols with names starting "ENABLE_"
 * and V0p2_REV.
 *
 * Specific sets by date may also be available.
 *
 * These are meant be be fairly stable over time;
 * it is more likely that new ENABLE_ flags may be introduced
 * than old ones change their status.
 *
 * Values here that are #undef are to show
 * that they are available to be defined in some configs.
 *
 * NOT to be included by ANY library routines,
 * only other CONFIG includes.
