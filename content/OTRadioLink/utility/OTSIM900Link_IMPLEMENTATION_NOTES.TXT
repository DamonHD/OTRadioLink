Preparing the SIM900 for use with the REV10

1) Find the power pin jumper (JP on the geeetech SIM900 v2.0) and bridge it with a blob of solder.

2) Setting the baud on the SIM900:

IMPORTANT: The current V0p2 with softserial cannot reach a high enough baud to communicate with the SIM900 by default. The following procedure is only tested on the Arduino UNO (20160311).

    - Make sure the two serial selector jumpers are set to SWserial (J7 on the geeetech SIM900 v2.0).
    - Put a CR1220 coin cell in the SIM900 shield.
    - Load the sketch OTRadioLink/dev/utils/setSim900Baud/setSim900Baud.ino onto an Arduino UNO (do NOT edit the sketch!).
    - Unplug the Arduino and attach the SIM900 shield.
    - Plug the Arduino back in, press the button on the shield, wait for red RED on shield to come on, and open the serial terminal.
    - WRITE WHAT WILL APPEAR ON TERMINAL IF CORRECTLY COMMUNICATING HERE. If it tells you what the baud is then you can talk to it.

++ Current Baud ++
AT+IPR?

+IPR: 0

OK

    - Copy the following into the terminal window (without "s) and press enter: "s2400\r"
    - WRITE EXPECTED RESPONSE FROM SIM900 HERE. It will give a baud back...

Other notes:
- The current version of OTSoftSerial (20160311) can run at a maximum of 2400 baud.
- SIM900 shield pin out:
    Shield         | Arduino UNO | V0p2_REV10
    soft serial Rx | D7          | 8
    soft serial Tx | D8          | 5
    power toggle   | D9          | A2
