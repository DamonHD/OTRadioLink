Various RN2483 notes:

Currently variables defined in functions (in .cpp file). Ugly but no time to do it properly

Sleep Mode:
  - Does not wake from sleep in our particular implementation.
  - You tell it how long to sleep for in 100s of ms and it *should* wake up at the end.

Data rate:
  - 5 data rates (dr) in LoRaWAN class A. Each coresponds to a different spread factor (SF) and has a different max payload length:
    1) dr 0 = SF12, 59/59   octets*
    2) dr 1 = SF11, 59/59   octets*
    3) dr 2 = SF10, 59/59   octets*
    4) dr 3 =  SF9, 123/123 octets*
    5) dr 4 =  SF8, 230/250 octets*
    6) dr 5 =  SF7, 230/250 octets*
*<repeater compatible>/<not repeater compatible>, assumed octets (not labeled in LoRaWan spec table 16/17)

DHD2060302: JSON frame lengths above 49 seem to fail at the low data rates 0/1/2.

Testing data rates:
unit    datarate
21      0
23      1
24      2


Some failed packets:

{"@":"e8e7","+":4,"L":250,"T|C16":389,"H|%":26,"O":1}
invalid_data_len�106
Radio: {"@":"e8e7","+":4,"L":250,"T|C16":389,"H|%":26,"O":1�

Common points:
- if length is over 100, returns "invalid_data_len"
- Occasionally fails with a "no_free_ch". No idea what it means though.
